rt-scheduler_simulator
======================

Ted Baker created a OS inspired task scheduler simulator for his students to implement different scheduling algorithms.

Almost all of thise code was generated by Ted Baker. My contribution exists in two files:
[master/threads-sched_tbs.adb](master/threads-sched_tbs.adb)
[master/threads-sched_tbs.ads](master/threads-sched_tbs.ads)
